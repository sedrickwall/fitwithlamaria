	🪲 Logic Bug	“Good morning” appears in evening.	Greeting reflects local time and includes user’s first name.	Use Date.getHours() to determine greeting (morning<12, afternoon<18, else “Good evening”) and append ${user.firstName} from Firestore/Auth.
2	💡 UX Enhancement	No intro explaining how the app works before paywall.	Show simple “3-step how it works” carousel before signup / paywall.	Insert carousel after onboarding video and before Stripe paygate: 1️⃣ Workout → 2️⃣ Puzzle → 3️⃣ Progress & Community. Use large text + icons.
3	💸 Paywall Logic	Users want to try the app before paying.	Allow basic features (workout + puzzle) free; lock community and premium programs.	Add flag users.premium == false → bypass Stripe modal for first 3 sessions or 7-day trial.
4	🪲 Auth Bug	“Continue without sign-in” did not work for puzzle.	Free users should still play puzzle without logging in.	Fix router guard: if !user allow /puzzle route but store progress in localStorage; disable Firestore writes until login.
5	🎨 UI Enhancement	No images on workout cards.	Each workout card shows YouTube thumbnail or static preview.	Use https://img.youtube.com/vi/{videoId}/hqdefault.jpg as card image; lazy-load for performance.
6	🎯 Game Logic	Users want to “guess any word.”	Puzzle should accept any valid 5-letter input and give feedback.	Remove word-list restriction or add “fallback accepted guess” if word not in dictionary; display result (present, absent, etc.).
7	💡 Feature Request	Hints for puzzles (e.g., category or myth topic).	Each puzzle shows a short hint before first guess.	Add hint field to puzzles collection (e.g., “Category: Balance”, “Myth: Lifting weights is unsafe for seniors”) and render above grid.
8	✨ New Puzzle Type	Add Crossword option.	Provide alternative puzzle for variety.	Integrate simple open-source React crossword component; alternate Wordle/Crossword daily via puzzle type field.
9	📱 Responsive Bug	On iPhone, keyboard covers guess input.	Keyboard should not obstruct input field.	Add scrollIntoView() on input focus, use KeyboardAvoidingView (React Native) or env(safe-area-inset-bottom) padding for mobile web. Test Safari + Chrome iOS.
