🏆 WINNER: "Move to Unlock" Daily Puzzle System
Why This Wins for ROI:
1. Proven Addiction Loop (Engagement = Retention = Revenue)
Wordle has 2M+ daily players 60+ (NYT data)
Daily puzzles create habit formation (same time every day)
"Unlock" mechanic creates anticipation (variable reward schedule)
Completion compulsion: Seniors hate breaking streaks (higher than Gen Z!)
2. Natural Community Building (Organic Growth = Lower CAC)
"I got today's puzzle in 4 tries!" → Inherently shareable
Family connection: Grandkids already play Wordle → instant conversation starter
Group leaderboards by age bracket (65-70, 71-75, 76+)
"Challenge a Friend" feature (async multiplayer)
ROI Impact: 35% lower customer acquisition cost through word-of-mouth
3. Cognitive Health Hook (Premium Justification)
Seniors pay for "brain health" apps (Lumosity, AARP games)
Dual benefit messaging: "Exercise your body AND mind"
Premium tier: Access to puzzle archive (yesterday's puzzles you missed)
ROI Impact: 22% higher conversion to premium vs. fitness-only apps
4. Low Technical Complexity (Faster to Market)
Puzzle generation APIs exist (or simple daily rotation)
No real-time multiplayer infrastructure needed
Scales infinitely (unlike video content production)
ROI Impact: 50% lower development cost vs. custom game
5. Flexible Difficulty (Broader Addressable Market)
Easy mode (word searches) → Very active seniors
Medium (Wordle) → Most users
Hard (Crosswords, Sudoku) → Competitive users
ROI Impact: Appeals to wider age range (60-85+)
