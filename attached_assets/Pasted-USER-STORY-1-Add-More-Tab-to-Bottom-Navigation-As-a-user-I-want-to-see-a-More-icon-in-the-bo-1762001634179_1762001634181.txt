If logged out → open /login (Google Sign-In via Firebase).

If logged in → open /account (profile + settings).

Button labeled:

“Join Now” for new users.

I want to explore some parts of the app (like Dashboard or Progress) without logging in,
so that I can experience Fit with LaMaria before committing.

App loads with limited anonymous state.

“Progress,” “More,” and “Community” icons still visible, but gated as appropriate:

Progress → shows encouragement screen

Writes only after login.

🧩 USER STORY 6 — Accessibility + UI Simplicity for “More” Section

As a 65+ user,
I want the “More” menu to feel calm, clear, and familiar,
so that I don’t feel overwhelmed by options.

🎯 Acceptance Criteria

Menu options have both icon + label (e.g., 🧭 “Progress”).

Use pastel high-contrast backgrounds.

Minimum text size: 16–18px.

Each button occupies full width (no small touch targets).

🔒 Access Control

None — applies globally.

🧩 USER STORY 7 — Premium Subscription Integration (Optional Next Phase)

As a logged-in user,
I want to view and manage my subscription directly from my account page,
so that I can upgrade, cancel, or view billing info easily.

🎯 Acceptance Criteria

Display current subscription plan (Monthly / Yearly).

“Manage Billing” → opens Stripe Customer Portal (via /api/payments/portal).

If unsubscribed → show “Upgrade Now →” (Stripe Checkout link).

⚙️ Technical Notes

Store users.subscriptionId and users.premium in Firestore.

Backend route connects to Stripe API:

router.post("/portal", async (req, res) => {
  const portalSession = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
    customer: stripeCustomerId,
    return_url: "https://fitwithlamaria.replit.app/account",
  });
  res.json({ url: portalSession.url });
});
